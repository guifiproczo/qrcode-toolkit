However, some users complained that the game was too buggy, glitchy and poorly optimized.

Overall, Refinish Network - Paintboss VR is a game that may appeal to some fans of painting and VR, but may disappoint others who expect more polish and depth.

If you are interested in this game, you may want to wait for a sale or a patch before buying it.

The developers of Refinish Network - Paintboss VR have not released any major updates or patches for the game since its launch in November 2017.

The game's Steam Community page shows no announcements or discussions from the developers either.
 
This suggests that the game has been abandoned by the developers and that no further improvements or additions are expected. This may disappoint some users who were hoping for more support and communication from the developers, and who were looking forward to new features and content. This may also affect the game's reputation and sales, as potential buyers may be deterred by the lack of updates and feedback.
 
Therefore, if you are interested in Refinish Network - Paintboss VR, you should be aware that the game is unlikely to receive any updates or patches in the future, and that what you see is what you get.
