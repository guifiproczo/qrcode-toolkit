In this article, we will highlight some of the key features and benefits of LightWave 11.6 that make it a versatile and powerful 3D software for any project.
  
## New Ways to Animate
  
LightWave 11.6 introduces new tools and options for animating 3D objects and characters with more control and flexibility. Some of the new features include:
  
- **Spline Control:** This tool allows you to use nulls or other objects as nodes in a spline to control or deform objects such as tentacles, tails, whips or even elevators. You can easily adjust the tension, bias and continuity of the spline nodes to create smooth and natural movements.
- **Raycast Motion:** This feature uses raycasting technology to make an animated object aware of its surroundings. For example, you can make a character walk on uneven terrain or a car follow a road without using complex rigging or scripting. You can also use raycasting to detect collisions, intersections or normal orientations.
- **Compound Node:** This feature simplifies node networks by allowing you to package up complex flows into a single node. You can create custom compound nodes or use existing ones to streamline your workflow and save time.

## Streamlined Real-Time Virtual Production, Pre-Viz and Game Development
  
LightWave 11.6 also supports NVIDIA CgFX shader technology, which enables you to create 3D assets for real-time applications and view them in LightWave OpenGL exactly as they will appear in the final display engine. You can also use normal maps to enhance the quality of low-polygon objects or characters, and create custom CgFX shaders or use existing ones.
  
This feature is ideal for virtual production, pre-visualization or game development, as it allows you to preview your assets in real time and make adjustments as needed.
  
## Output to 3D Printers
  
With the growing popularity of 3D printing, LightWave 11.6 makes it easy for you to output your models to standard 3D printing file formats, such as STL, VRML and PLY. You can also export models with color vertex maps for 3D printers that support color printing.
