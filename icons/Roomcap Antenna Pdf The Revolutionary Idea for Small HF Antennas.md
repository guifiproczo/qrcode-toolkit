# RoomCap Antenna: A New HF Antenna with Small Dimensions and High Efficiency
 
If you are looking for a new HF antenna that can fit in a small space and provide excellent performance, you might be interested in the RoomCap Antenna. This antenna was developed by Felix Meyer HB9ABX, who claims that it has a revolutionary design that allows it to achieve the same efficiency as large antennas with much smaller dimensions. In this article, we will explain what the RoomCap Antenna is, how it works, and what are its advantages and disadvantages.
 
## What is the RoomCap Antenna?
 
The RoomCap Antenna is a vertical antenna that consists of a tube of 5 cm diameter and a length between 50 to 170 cm, depending on the frequency, with an additional 25 cm length for the connection and mechanical mounting space. The tube contains a remote frequency adjustment (RFA) device that can tune the antenna to any frequency of the band with a low SWR. The antenna also has a capacity hat at the top, which increases the radiation resistance and reduces the losses. The antenna can be built as a monoband or a multiband antenna for 10-15-20-40-80 m (and WARC) bands, and even for 160 m with a larger tube[^1^].

## How does the RoomCap Antenna work?
 
The RoomCap Antenna works by creating a high current loop at the top of the tube, which radiates efficiently. The RFA device inside the tube adjusts the impedance of the antenna to match the 50 Ohm feedline, without the need of a tuner. The capacity hat at the top also helps to increase the radiation resistance and reduce the losses. The antenna has a circular radiation pattern in the horizontal plane and a broad minimum upward in the vertical plane, with a low angle of radiation between 15 to 25 degrees[^1^]. This makes it suitable for DX contacts.
 
## What are the advantages of the RoomCap Antenna?
 
The main advantage of the RoomCap Antenna is its small size and high efficiency. The antenna can be mounted on a car roof or on a balcony, without requiring any support or wires. It can also be used as a portable or fixed antenna, as it works well at low heights above ground. The antenna has a low SWR on all bands and does not need a tuner. The RFA device allows quick and easy tuning to any frequency of the band. The antenna also has a low angle of radiation, which is ideal for DX contacts[^1^].
 
## What are the disadvantages of the RoomCap Antenna?
 
The main disadvantage of the RoomCap Antenna is its high cost and complexity. The antenna requires a special RFA device that is not commercially available and has to be built by following a detailed construction guide[^1^]. The antenna also requires a power supply for the RFA device and a control unit for adjusting the frequency. The antenna may also have some limitations in terms of bandwidth and power handling[^2^]. The antenna may also be affected by nearby objects or structures that can alter its impedance or radiation pattern[^3^].
 
## Conclusion
 
The RoomCap Antenna is a new HF antenna that offers a small size and high efficiency for DX contacts. It has a unique design that uses a tube with an RFA device and a capacity hat to create an efficient radiating loop. It can be used as a mobile, portable or fixed antenna, without needing any support or wires. It has a low SWR on all bands and does not need a tuner. However, it also has some drawbacks, such as its high cost and complexity, its limited bandwidth and power handling, and its sensitivity to nearby objects or structures.
