## How to Set Up ZeroTier for Anno 2070?
 
Here are the steps to set up ZeroTier for Anno 2070:
 
1. One player (only one) needs to create a (free) account on ZeroTier.com, and create a network. This player will be the administrator of the network and will have access to the admin console. The network has a specific ID which must be sent to any players who want to join it (through Discord, e-mail, etc.).
2. Everyone (admin too) must close both Ubisoft Connect/Steam, install ZeroTier on their computer, do a right-click on the ZeroTier icon at the bottom-right of the screen, click on "Join Network" and copy/paste the ID of the network in the input box before clicking on Join. This attempt will fail, access denied. This is normal and mandatory: It permits to populate the personal IP and "Node ID" of everyone in the admin console of the network.
3. The administrator only needs to go back to the admin console, and tick the boxes in the "AUTH?" column which can be found in the "Members" section so to authorize them in the network. This is a one-time requirement, no need to do that in the future (except to accept new members).
4. Everyone must restart ZeroTier and wait few seconds. Then they should check the line "Status" in "Show Networks" to be sure that it is written "OK", and they should verify that the tick is present at the left of the ID/Name in the right-click menu of ZeroTier.
5. Everyone must launch Ubisoft Connect/Steam and start Anno 2070. The game should detect ZeroTier as a LAN connection and allow multiplayer games without any issues.

## How to Play Anno 2070 in Multiplayer LAN Mode?
 
Once you have set up ZeroTier for Anno 2070, you can play multiplayer games as follows:

- Multiplayer games are accessed from the Mission Map ("Join Multiplayer") or created via the "Start as Multiplayer" option when creating Continuous or Single Mission games.
